Section 1: Usage                   *PrivateCommentsUsage*

Assuming you've set up the default abbreviations
(see |Troubleshooting| if you haven't) you can type:

While in your main editing window you can run these
commands:

:pcv to View any comments associated with lines in the
current file.

:pcr to Record a new comment associated with the line your
cursor is currently on.

:pcd to Delete the comment associated with the line your
cursor is currentyl on.

:pcc to Close the Private Comments window.

To change a comment just record a new one on the same line.

In the Private Comments window you can run these:

:pcj to jump to the line in the main window that corresponds
with the comment your cursor is currently on. For example,
if the comment is "35:rename me" and you type `:pcj` your
main window will jump to line 35.

:pcc to Close the Private Comments window.

============================================================
Section 2: Troubleshooting *PrivateCommentsTroubleshooting*

Requirements:

* You'll need the "pc" and "git" executables to be in your
  path. If you're not sure what this means ask a geek
  familar with unix / linux.
* You'll need to have started the private comments server.
  If you're using bash or zsh a good way to start it is
  to run

    private_comments && disown

  and then close the window. If you need to kill it you can
do so with

    pkill private_comments

To check if the server is running run

    pgrep private_comments

That will return the ID of the process if it's running or
nothing if it isn't.

General Errors

* You must be using a file within a git repository.
  It must also be a "normal" git repository, with a
  hidden ".git" directory at the root of it.
* The line you're trying to comment on must be committed. If
  it is new, or has changes since the last commit. Commit
  it, and then try recording the comment.
