Section 1: Usage                   *PrivateCommentsUsage*

Assuming you've set up the default abbreviations
(see |Configuration| if you haven't) you can type:

While in your main editing window you can run these
commands:

:pcv to View any comments associated with lines in the
current file.

:pcr to Record a new comment associated with the line your
cursor is currently on.

:pcd to Delete the comment associated with the line your
cursor is currentyl on.

:pcc to Close the Private Comments window.

To change a comment just record a new one on the same line.

In the Private Comments window you can run these:

:pcj to jump to the line in the main window that corresponds
with the comment your cursor is currently on. For example,
if the comment is "35:rename me" and you type `:pcj` your
main window will jump to line 35.

:pcc to Close the Private Comments window.

============================================================
Section 2: Configuration *PrivateCommentsConfiguration*

Section 3: Troubleshooting *PrivateCommentsTroubleshooting*

------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Requirements             *private_comments_requirements*

* You'll need the "pc" and "git" executables to be in your
  path. If you're not sure what this means ask a geek
  familar with unix / linux.
* You'll need to have started the private comments server.
  If you're using bash or zsh a good way to start it is
  to run

    private_comments && disown

  and then close the window. If you need to kill it you can
do so with

    pkill private_comments

To check if the server is running run

    pgrep private_comments

That will return the ID of the process if it's running or
nothing if it isn't.

------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 General Errors         *private_comments_general_errors*

* You must be using a file within a git repository.
  It must also be a "normal" git repository, with a
  hidden ".git" directory at the root of it.
* The line you're trying to comment on must be committed. If
  it is new, or has changes since the last commit. Commit
  it, and then try recording the comment.

------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Disappearing Comments    *private_comments_disappearing*

My comment disappeared!

Comments are tied to a specific version of a line of code.
That way they don't become obsolete. If you leave yourself a
"TODO" on a function telling yourself to rename it, and then
you rename it, and commit the change, your comment will
dissapear. It's not gone. If you use git to travel back in
time and see older versions of a file, you'll see the old
comments.
