# a vim plugin for private_comments

[Private Comments](https://private-comments.com) allows you to record comments _in_ your code that aren't _in_ the codebase. 

This plugin allows you to integrate Vim with Private Comments.

## Requirements

* the Private Comments server must be running locally
* the `pc` client must be in your `$PATH` 


Note: [This article](https://medium.com/@jalendport/what-exactly-is-your-shell-path-2f076f02deb4) describes [PATH] and how to work with it if you're unfamiliar.
